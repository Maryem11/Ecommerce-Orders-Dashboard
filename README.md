## Project Overview
I designed this interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze over 1,500 e-commerce orders across multiple countries. It highlights key metrics like customer return rate, order trends, and category performance. The dashboard includes dynamic filters, map visuals, and customer behavior insights to drive business decisions. It demonstrates my ability to create clean, analytical, and executive-ready reports using Power BI and DAX.

**Objective:** Visualize key business metrics to support decision-making in e-commerce.

## Dataset & Process
- **Data:** E-commerce transactions (Orders, Customers, Products)  
- **Steps:** Data cleaning (Power Query), calculated columns (DAX), relationships set in model

## Key Insights
- 85% of customers are returning, indicating strong loyalty and reduced acquisition costs.  
- 1,500 orders from 479 customers suggest each customer averages over three purchases.  
- The average spend per customer is $207, while the average order value is $66, confirming repeat purchasing behavior.  
- Customers who opted into marketing spent 7% more on average ($132 vs. $123), highlighting the clear ROI of email and SMS campaigns.  
- Revenue peaks in August 2022 and Aprilâ€“May 2023 suggest seasonal or promotion-driven demand.  
- Toys and Sports categories consistently generate higher revenue, making them strong areas for continued focus.  
- The customer map shows concentrations in the U.S. and East Asia, suggesting where to strengthen logistics and marketing.  
- Revenue shows a generally upward trend, with a temporary dip in February 2023, reflecting business growth and stability.
